# Bamazon

## Description

* **What is Bamazon?**
Bamazon is a CLI app that resembles an Amazon-like storefront. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory, which is stored on a database using MySQL.

* **How Does Bamazon Work?**
This app uses MySQL to store inventory data for products into a database, and Node.js to connect with that database and allow the user to interact with the data by going through prompts created with the inquirer node package.

* **Target Audience of Bamazon**
The target audience is individuals interested in command line applications that utilize inquirer prompts, and individuals who enjoy simple but effective applications that store and manipulate data using MySQL. It may also attract those who love to shop!

* **Purpose of the Project**
The purpose of this project was to practice Node.js and MySQL concepts learned in Week 12 of the UR Coding Bootcamp.
